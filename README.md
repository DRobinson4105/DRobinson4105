## Hi I'm David Robinson
I am passionate about leveraging machine learning and computer vision to address real-world challenges and enhance human-technology interactions.

Currently, I am an undergraduate researcher at the UCF Center for Research in Computer Vision under Dr. Mubarak Shah, where I explore hand-object interaction to quantify human movement control in natural environments using various 3D pose estimation methods.

I aim to continue advancing the field of AI and computer vision, focusing on innovative solutions that bridge the gap between technology and real-world applications.
